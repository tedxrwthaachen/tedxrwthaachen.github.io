        <h2>About TEDx RWTHAachen</h2>
        <p>The yearly TEDxRWTHAachen conferences are organized by an Aachen-based student initiative called <b>AiX Talks e.V.</b>. Since the initiative was founded in 2013, we have been dedicated to fostering ideas worth spreading through TEDx events, with nine successful events hosting almost 300 guests each.</p>
        <p>Driven by our passion for innovation and community engagement, our student-led initiative curates thought-provoking talks and experiences that inspire meaningful conversations, amplifying voices and igniting change.</p>
        <p>At the heart of our mission is the belief that everyone has a story worth sharing and ideas that can shape the future.</p>

        <h2>About TEDx, x = independently organized event</h2>
        <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.</p>
